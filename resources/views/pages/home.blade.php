                                Food is adulterated to increase the quantity and make more profit. The food is sucked of its nutrients and the place where the food is grown is often contaminated.

                            <p>
                                An adulterant  is  a  chemical  substance  which  should  not  be  contained  within  other  substances  (e.g.  Food, beverages, and fuels) for legal or other reasons. The addition of adulterants is called adulteration.
                            </p>

                                Every consumer wants to get the maximum quantity of a commodity for as low a price as possible. This attitude of the consumers being coupled with the intention of the traders as well as the manufacturer to increase the margin of a profit as high as the variable market demand permits generates a vicious circle where the quality of the commodity gets reduced of vital elements and the process is defined as adulteration.

                                <p>
                                    The UP Food and Drug Administration today said it has found detergent in one of the samples of Mother Dairy's milk packets, a claim contested by the Delhi-based company. "Results showed that the samples were sub-standard and one of the two contained detergent," UP FDA official in Agra, Ram Naresh Yadav, told PTI. The samples had been picked up from Mother Dairy's collection centres in Bah in November 2014. "The samples were first sent to Lucknow and later to Kolkata on the demand of the company," Yadav said.

                                    A officer of the UP Food Safety and Drug Administration based in Barabanki ordered tests on a dozen samples of Nestle's Maggi instant noodles at the state laboratory in Gorakhpur, and repeat tests at the Central Food Laboratory in Kolkata, a referral lab.The Gorakhpur lab tested for monosodium glutamate (MSG) to check Nestle's claim that Maggi had none. Both tests found MSG; in addition, the Kolkata lab found "very high quantities" of lead - 17.2 parts per million - according to UP authorities.
