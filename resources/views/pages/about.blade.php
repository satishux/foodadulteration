                            The mission of the department of Computational Biology & Bioinformatics is to build and maintain an interdisciplinary community, with student engagement, that will collaboratively propose and solve problems in biotechnology and bioinformatics. Bioinformatics is considered to be a confluence of Biology, Computer Science, Information Technology, Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, and Medicine with the objectives of developing tools to analyze biological, biochemical, biophysical data and to generate new knowledge. Computing, information technology and software engineering strength of India in academia and industry has provided a fresh impetus to computational biology and bioinformatics. The Trained person will be receiving specialty in computational biology in order to become 'Computer Scientist who specializes in Biology' or 'Biologist who specializes in Computer Science'.
                            Bioinformatics is enabling life sciences to invent novel drugs as well as drug delivery systems and facilitate an understanding of the biological processes with the goal to serve primarily agriculture and healthcare sectors.Bioinformatics has become a 'Bonafied Discipline' to revolutionalize Biotechnology. Students are well absorbed in the different Scientific Labs, IT-Industry, Pharmaceutical Industry, Academics, Research, Higher Studies and working as Scientists, Academicians, Research Coordinators, Project Developer and Research Scholars etc. in India and abroad with smart packages. Department is determined for the development of bioinformatics enormously, making it capable to form a new society of biotechnology and biological scientists, who may call themselves 'Bioinformaticians'.
